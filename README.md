Robot Simulation for FANUC R-2000iC/210L and Stäubli TP80 Fast Picker with MATLAB GUI Code
This project presents a robot simulation using MATLAB GUI code that provides the forward kinematics solution for FANUC R-2000iC/210L robot and the inverse kinematics solution for Stäubli TP80 Fast Picker robot. The simulation takes parameters such as DH parameters and position and outputs the position and orientation of the robot arm.

# How it Works?
When the simulation is run, the GUI interface is displayed, and the user enters parameters such as DH parameters and position. Then, the simulation calculates and visualizes the position and orientation of the robot arm.

# User Guide
To use the simulation, follow the steps below:

Open MATLAB program and navigate to the directory where the project is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, run the staubli_sim or fanuc_sim command.
The GUI interface will open. Enter parameters such as DH parameters and position.
Click on the "Calculate" button.
The position and orientation of the robot arm will be visualized on the simulation screen.

# Requirements
This project requires MATLAB R2021b or newer.
